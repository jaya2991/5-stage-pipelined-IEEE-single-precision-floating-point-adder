# 5-stage-pipelined-IEEE-single-precision-floating-point-adder
The project involves design of a 5-stage pipelined IEEE single-precision floating-point adder

This folder contains code for un-pipelined FP adder and 5 stage pipelined IEEE single-precisioned FP adder.

The folder has following files.

1) unpipelined.py - this file has implementation of unpipelined FP adder including main function. 
In order to execute unpipelined FP adder, we need to run this file as,
"python unpipelined.py"

2)pipelined.py - this file has implementation of 5 stage pipelined FP adder including main function. 
In order to execute pipelined FP adder, we need to run this file as,
"python pipelined.py"

3) stages.py : In this file, all the 5 stages are implemented.

4) fpnumber.py : in this file, the given number is represented in floating point format.

5) util.py : In this file, all the conversions like decimal to binary and binary to decimal are handled.
